/**
 * This package contains all classed that used to create Allocator RESTFul Api (Allocator Endpoint).<br> 
 * 
 * In computing, Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture style for building scalable web services.<br>
 * REST gives a coordinated set of constraints to the design of components in a distributed hypermedia system 
 * that can lead to a higher performing and more maintainable architecture.<br>
 * 
 * RESTful systems typically, but not always, communicate over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol with the same HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) 
 * which web browsers use to retrieve web pages and to send data to remote servers. <br>
 *  
 * REST interfaces usually involve collections of resources with identifiers, for example /campaign/list, which can be operated upon using standard verbs,
 * such as DELETE /campaign/01245. <br>
